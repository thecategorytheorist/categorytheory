#### Prologue

Let me start of by saying that this strange VS code extension is actually useful. And [BIBA](https://open.spotify.com/track/4IQqOlTZpfjnSTOArpZX5j?si=f0e5132314904b3a "Spotify'") is one hell of a song. Now with the formalities taken care of, let the rant begin. If you are reading this, you already know me. Or you are a high schooler with way too much time (been there). To the random high schooler I owe no explanation but my friends would know that I already have a fairly famous blog (Instagram story announcing my latest post got 4 impressions !!). I have no idea what I'll be posting here. Some rants, maybe. Top quality anonymised accounts of my attempts at being cool, most likely. Stay tuned, I guess.
